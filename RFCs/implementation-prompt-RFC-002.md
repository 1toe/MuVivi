# Implementation Prompt for RFC-002: Component Architecture & Design System

## Role and Mindset
You are a senior software developer with extensive experience in building robust, maintainable, and scalable systems. Approach this implementation with the following mindset:

1. **Architectural Thinking**: Consider how this implementation fits into the broader system architecture
2. **Quality Focus**: Prioritize code quality, readability, and maintainability over quick solutions
3. **Future-Proofing**: Design with future requirements and scalability in mind
4. **Mentorship**: Explain your decisions as if mentoring a junior developer
5. **Pragmatism**: Balance theoretical best practices with practical considerations
6. **Defensive Programming**: Anticipate edge cases and potential failures
7. **System Perspective**: Consider impacts on performance, security, and user experience

## Context
This implementation covers RFC-002, which focuses on establishing the component architecture, design system, CSS tokens, custom hooks, and context API setup. This is a critical foundation for all subsequent RFCs. Please refer to the following documents:
- @PRD.md for overall product requirements
- @FEATURES.md for detailed feature specifications
- @RULES.md for project guidelines and standards
- @RFC-002-Component-Architecture.md for the specific requirements being implemented

## Two-Phase Implementation Approach
This implementation MUST follow a strict two-phase approach:

### Phase 1: Implementation Planning
1. Thoroughly analyze the requirements and existing codebase
2. Develop and present a comprehensive implementation plan (see details below)
3. DO NOT write any actual code during this phase
4. Wait for explicit user approval of the plan before proceeding to Phase 2
5. Address any feedback, modifications, or additional requirements from the user

### Phase 2: Implementation Execution
1. Only begin after receiving explicit approval of the implementation plan
2. Follow the approved plan, noting any necessary deviations
3. Implement in logical segments as outlined in the approved plan
4. Explain your approach for complex sections
5. Conduct a self-review before finalizing

## Implementation Guidelines

### Before Writing Code
1. Analyze RFC-001 to ensure it's correctly implemented
2. Review RULES.md section on Component Architecture (section 5)
3. Understand the design system tokens and their relationship to Tailwind
4. Plan component hierarchy and reusability patterns
5. Consider how Context API will be structured for scalability

### Implementation Standards
1. Follow all naming conventions from @RULES.md (section 3)
2. Use CSS Modules for component isolation
3. Implement BEM-like naming for CSS classes
4. Create reusable, composable components
5. Ensure accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA basics)
6. Write comprehensive JSDoc comments
7. Include unit tests (70%+ coverage) for all components
8. Use React hooks (useState, useContext, useReducer, useCallback)

### Implementation Process
1. Provide a detailed implementation plan including:
   - Design token strategy and organization
   - Component hierarchy and dependencies
   - CSS module organization
   - Context API structure
   - Custom hooks implementation order
   - Testing strategy for components
   - Potential challenges and solutions
2. Wait for explicit user approval before proceeding
3. Implement in this order:
   - Design tokens and theme.css
   - Base UI components (Button, Slider, etc.)
   - Context API setup
   - Custom hooks
   - CSS animation system
   - Comprehensive testing
4. Ensure each component is thoroughly tested before moving to the next

## Code Quality Assurance
As a senior developer, ensure your implementation meets these quality standards:
1. **Readability**: Code should follow consistent patterns, be self-documenting
2. **Testability**: Components should be easily unit testable
3. **Modularity**: Each component has single responsibility
4. **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, semantic HTML, keyboard navigation
5. **Performance**: Avoid unnecessary re-renders with memoization where appropriate
6. **Consistency**: All components follow same pattern and structure
7. **Documentation**: JSDoc for all exports, README in component folders if complex

## Scope Limitation
Implement only RFC-002 as specified. Do not implement RFC-003 or later. Foundation components only, not application-level components.

## Final Deliverables
1. All design tokens (CSS variables)
2. All base UI components (Button, Slider, ColorPicker, Modal, Notification, Dropdown)
3. Context API setup (ProjectContext with useProject hook)
4. Custom hooks (useUndo, useEffect patterns)
5. CSS module organization and animations
6. Comprehensive test suite (70%+ coverage)
7. Documentation and JSDoc comments
8. Assessment of implementation quality and future improvements
